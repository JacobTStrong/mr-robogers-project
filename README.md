## Description

For my third independent project at Epicodus, I was instructed to create a web application that takes a user-inputted number and returns an array of numbers ranging from 0 to the user-inputted number. I know what you're thinking ~ooooooo how bland, Jacob~. I SCOFF! This application doesn't just return an array. No, no, no... It returns a ROBOT MR. ROGERS-THEMED array. We're combining the classics here, people. It's got beeps. It's got boops. And it's got one simple question... Won't you be my neighbor?

## Installation and Setup

* Make sure you have the latest versions of the related software installed on your machine.
* Clone this repository to your desktop by executing $ git clone https://github.com/JacobTStrong/mr-robogers-project in the command line.
* Locate the directory on your computer and open it in your text editor to view the code.
* Double-click on the "index.html" file within the project directory to open the web page in your browser.
* Once the web page loads, you will be met with the type of flavor text that makes it clear why I chose not to pursue creative writing.
* Ah, yes there will also be a text box and a submit button. Enter a number into the text box and click submit to see the application's function in all its glory.
* Whatever you do... DO NOT enter a letter. That should be easy, right?

## Known Bugs

* None at this time
